# AIMSS Data Pre-Processing Workshop
Hi everyone! Welcome to the AI in Medicine Student Society's Intro to Data Pre-Processing workshop.

This repository stores the data we are going to be using and the steps to set up the Colab notebook.

## First steps
We need somewhere to keep the data and the code:
* Visit https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive
* Create folder `aimss_data_workshop`

## Download Data
Because we're going to be using many different datasets, I made them available in a .zip file.

* Above, click `â­³ Code > Download ZIP`, and save zip file above to your local machine
* Unzip file to extract data
* Upload all newly-extracted files to `aimss_data_workshop` in your Google Drive

## Prepare Notebook
In order to edit the demo notebook, you must save your own copy on your drive.
* Visit https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J9osIwMhiFeuf_XfQnK06NScdhTvysL0?usp=sharing
* Follow `File > Save a Copy In Drive`
* *OPTIONAL*: On your copy, follow `File > Locate in Drive`.  Move notebook to `aimss_data_workshop`. (If this is not done, it will be in a new folder in your Drive called `Colab Notebooks`)
